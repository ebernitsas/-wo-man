1--Abuse0
I refuse to live in fear of someone who is supposed to be my protector. I tried to make our relationship work, but your abuse is too much for anyone to handle. --p2

The way you treat me is not the way you treat someone you love. I respect myself enough to say goodbye to you. Make no mistake about it - we are finished.--end

2--Abuse1
The way you treat me is wrong. If you don't realize that the way you treat me is wrong, then I suggest going to therapy to figure out why you treat the people you love like you do. If you keep going this way you're going to find yourself alone. --p2

I'll no longer take your abuse. I did love you at one time, but those feelings are long forgotten. Please do not try to contact me again because we are over.--end

3--Cheating

I know you've been cheating. I thought I meant something to you, but obviously you only care about yourself. I never want to see you again. Don't call me. Don't text me. Don't even mutter my name. --p2

Goodbye, and good riddance!--end

4--Generic

I am writing you this letter because I feel that we must end our relationship, the feelings I had for you are no longer there. I am sincerely sorry to bring you the news, but our relationship is finished.

You are and always will be a very special person to me, but you are not my soul mate, you are not that special person for me. I have tried to makes things work by giving us another chance, but I know and I think you do too deep down that we are mot meant to be together. 

You really are a special person, and i wish you all the happiness in your future, and really hope you find a girl that deserves someone special like you.--end
